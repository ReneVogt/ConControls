This library provides easy to use console UI controls. You can use it to quickly visualize results or progress
of a console application without the overhead of creating a UI with frameworks like Windows Forms or WPF etc.

A manual can be found [here](docs/Manual.md).  

The api documentation is a [Sandcastle](https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB) compiled html help file: [ConControls.chm](docs/api/ConControls.chm).
